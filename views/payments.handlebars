  <p>Braintree integration is not very user friendly. 2 separate site configurations are required
  There is limited support for the sandbox functionality for Braintree and PayPal outside of the US , as such make sure your sandbox accounts are both in the USA.</p><p>
    Getting the PayPal user credentials to put into Braintree is found with difficulty in the PayPal dashboard area, and is found under your account profile details in the xxxx's store area (very difficult to find).

  <h3>The .ENV File</h3>
  <p>For localhost testing the .ENV file on your local server should have the following lines added to the file.</p>
  <p>You will be able to get your actuals from the <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank">Braintree</a> website. You will need to register or login to receive the unique keys.</p>
